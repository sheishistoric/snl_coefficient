<h1>The SNL Coefficient</h1>

<p>This project attempts to determine a value for cast and crew members' association with <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, to then determine how closely associated a particular media property is with the show. For the purposes of this project, cast and crew applies to 1) repertory players, 2) featured players, 3) staff writers, and 4) head writers, during the show's period.</p>
<p>Data for the **snl_cast_crew.csv** has been collected from Wikipedia, IMDB, and fan sources. More information can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/sheishistoric/snl_coefficient">Github repository</a>.</p>
