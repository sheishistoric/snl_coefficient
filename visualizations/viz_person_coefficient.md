# Visualization of SNL coefficient per Person 
Similar to the chart visible here: https://pudding.cool/projects/vocabulary/
- Filters for ALL, ACTOR, WRITER, BOTH
- Find a person
- Scale of 0-1
- Tooltip would say the person and the coefficient  and # of SNL seasons)
- Roughly 200 people mapped per filter 

Need:
- Images of Each Performer (should be able to pull from IMDB, if none can default to SNL logo?)
- tick divisions (0 to .2869) (should also calculate what Lorne's actual coefficient would be based on this)
-
